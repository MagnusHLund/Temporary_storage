            While any of your uploaded files are on Magnus' server, Magnus' can look through any of said uploaded files.
            When your file is expired, a server-side program deletes the file, however it doesnt check through the
            database all the time.
            Once the deletion program has noticed your expired file, it will remove your file from Magnus' server and it
            cannot be accessed by you nor Magnus.
